# Bioinformatics Resources
This repo is dedicated to make bioinformatics resources available for anyone who wish to enter this field. (You may find it useful or not useful based on your level). I am not an expert in the field, just posting things based on my knowledge and the things which worked for me personally, they may/may not work with you, totally fine.

# Road-Map
In order to embark your journey in bioinformatics, you need to ask decide which branch of bioinformatics you are interested in the most? Up-to my very little knowledge, there are 2 main branches which are:
1. Structural Bioinformatics which deals with the structure of biomolecules and structural data, whether they are proteins, nucleic acids, or in-oragnic molecules. This branch requires a background mainly related to thermodynamics and biophysics.
2. The second branch is more concerned with High-throughput sequencing (HTS) and omics data (as genomics and transcriptomics) and the analysis of it's data.
Below are road-maps and resources for both direction whether you decided to start either of them.

## Structural Bioinformatics:
### Pre-requistes:
- Programming skills.
- Thermodynamics background.
- Structural biology background.
- Mathematics background.
- Machine-Learning background.

### Resources
| ```Skill``` | ```Resources``` | ```ETA to study``` | ```Extra Notes``` |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Programming Skills** | 1- [Bioinformatics sepcilization on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bioinformatics) <br /> 2- [Code Academy course](https://try.codecademy.com/learn-python-3?g_network=g&g_productchannel=&g_adid=528849219298&g_locinterest=&g_keyword=codecademy%20python&g_acctid=243-039-7011&g_adtype=&g_keywordid=kwd-295813001496&g_ifcreative=&g_campaign=account&g_locphysical=9112367&g_adgroupid=128133970308&g_productid=&g_source={sourceid}&g_merchantid=&g_placement=&g_partition=&g_campaignid=1726903838&g_ifproduct=&utm_id=t_kwd-295813001496:ag_128133970308:cp_1726903838:n_g:d_c&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid-search&utm_term=codecademy%20python&utm_campaign=INTL_Brand_Exact&utm_content=528849219298&g_adtype=search&g_acctid=243-039-7011&gclid=CjwKCAiA-bmsBhAGEiwAoaQNmkvUEs5k3Txr_0C9Bh997QBgD_XcBKY9HJjJByXMDI-orn45F4njARoCFVgQAvD_BwE) <br /> 3- [Python official website](https://www.learnpython.org/) <br /> 4- [Elzero channel on youtube and website](https://elzero.org/category/courses/mastering-python/) <br /> - [Python specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) <br /> 5- [Linux course on Future Learn](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/linux-for-bioinformatics) <br /> 6- [Introduction to R for Biologists](https://melbournebioinformatics.github.io/r-intro-biologists/intro_r_biologists.html) <br /> 7- [R for Biologists](https://www.rforbiologists.org/)  | 2-3 months | - Do not push yourself, it is totally fine if you are starting your journey. The journey demands time and patience. <br /> - The first 4 resources are for python, it is recommended that you start with python as it is the most used programming language and that it is very easy to begin with. <br /> - Make sure that you do lots of exercised and practices as this is the most important aspect in programming in general. The more you practice, the more you master it and become more fluent. <br /> - The linux course can be started after the python one, to avoid overlapping. <br /> - Consider letting R as a lower priority (you may not use throughout your work in structural bioinformatics). R mostly here used for data analysis and visualization. |
| **Thermodynamics and Structural Biology Background** | 1- [Text books found here in that folder](https://github.com/Ahhmedsamehh/Bioinformatics_resources/tree/main/Thermodynamics) <br /> 2- [This repo is amazing for both thermodynamics and structural biology](https://github.com/carlocamilloni/Structural-Bioinformatics) | 2 Months | - This step is critical, you may find these resources not useful for you. If so, you can share it here with me and I will merge the pull request and I will accept it. <br /> - My advice here is to enjoy that really, it is pure science and it is you laying the base for all of the future skills to follow. |
| **Mathematics Background** | 1- [Linear Algebra course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learnlinear-algebra-machine-learning) <br /> 2- [Linear Algebra course on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra) <br /> 3- [Multivariate Calculus course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-calculus?specialization=mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science) <br /> 4- [Differential Calculus course on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus) <br /> 5- [Linear Algebra lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVKj3LADCnA&list=PL49CF3715CB9EF31D) | 1 Month for Linear Algebra and 1 Month for Calculus | - I really recommend starting Linear Algebra before Calculus as it may pave the way for some concepts that you are going to need in Calculus (Matrix transformation, inverse matrix,...) |
| **Machine Learning Background** | 1- [Machine Learning specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction?) <br /> 2- [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6FNC6YRfRQc_FbeQrF8BwGI) | 1-2 Months | - You can start this after finishing Mathematics. <br /> - Andrew NG is considered the most famous and the best one to explain Machine Learning in the world. |

### Extra Notes:
Do not rush and give the process time. I recommend that you start learning in the same order of the above table, but at the end do what you see best for you!
Practice makes perfect, make sure that the most important thing is to continuosly practice.
Also, do not be shy to ask those who have experience about career advices, things you do not understand, or even an general inquiry. It is totally fine if they did not reply, be brave.

### Extra Notes:
First of all, you have to decide and choose which track are you most interested in from Genomics, Transcriptomics, Proteomics, and Metabolomics.
A very important repo which has lots of beneficial resources (I even used it as a reference) is the following [repo](https://github.com/MohmedSoudy/Bioinformatics-pipeline?tab=readme-ov-file).
Practice makes perfect, make sure that the most important thing is to continuosly practice.
Also, do not be shy to ask those who have experience about career advices, things you do not understand, or even an general inquiry. It is totally fine if they did not reply, be brave.
