# Bioinformatics Resources
This repo is dedicated to make bioinformatics resources available for anyone who wish to enter this field. (You may find it useful or not useful based on your level). I am not an expert in the field, just posting things based on my knowledge and the things which worked for me personally, they may/may not work with you, totally fine.

# Road-Map
In order to embark your journey in bioinformatics, you need to ask decide which branch of bioinformatics you are interested in the most? Up-to my very little knowledge, there are 2 main branches which are:
1. Structural Bioinformatics which deals with the structure of biomolecules and structural data, whether they are proteins, nucleic acids, or in-oragnic molecules. This branch requires a background mainly related to thermodynamics and biophysics.
2. The second branch is more concerned with High-throughput sequencing (HTS) and omics data (as genomics and transcriptomics) and the analysis of it's data.
Below are road-maps and resources for both direction whether you decided to start either of them.

## Structural Bioinformatics:
### Pre-requistes:
- Programming skills.
- Thermodynamics background.
- Structural biology background.
- Mathematics background.
- Machine-Learning background.

The journey demands time and patience. <br /> - The first 4 resources are for python, it is recommended that you start with python as it is the most used programming language and that it is very easy to begin with. <br /> - Make sure that you do lots of exercised and practices as this is the most important aspect in programming in general. The more you practice, the more you master it and become more fluent. |
